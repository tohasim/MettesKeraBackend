## Meeting discipline
### How to contact the rest of the group if, for some reason, you are prevented from attending on an agreed day
- Absolute last time of saying you won't be here is 1 hr before meeting time
- If you know today you’ll be absent tomorrow - text the group today.
- If the bus is delayed - text the group as fast as possible.


## How to react as a group, if a member is repeatedly absent without announcing it to the group with an acceptable reason
As a group, we value everyday thriving. It’s therefore important to ask the individual member if they’re generally ok, and what we, as a group, can do for this individual to feel better.

## Transparency
Talk to each other. Be honest about anything you’re worried/tired/…etc about in either work, school or private life.
